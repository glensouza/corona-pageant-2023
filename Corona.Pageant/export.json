He considered the bleeding, paschal lamb offered as a sacrifice. He saw the sweet smelling of the incense as it ascended to God, representing the prayers of all gathered there. As He recalled the story of the Passover angel and the deliverance of God’s people from slavery in Egypt, a sense of His own destiny came upon him. ",
